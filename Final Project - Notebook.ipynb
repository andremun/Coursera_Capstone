    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Melbourne, Victoria is the second largest metropolitan area in Australia, with an estimated 5.191 million inhabitants as of 2019. According to [Mercer's Quality of living city ranking](https://mobilityexchange.mercer.com/Insights/quality-of-living-rankings) it is of the cities with the highest quality of life in the world, with one of the best education systems in the country according to [Quarely Simmonds Best Student's cities](https://www.topuniversities.com/city-rankings/2018#sorting=rank+custom=rank+order=desc+search=), making it an attractive city for families. However, Melbourne lacks of large theme and attraction parks. According to the state government of Victoria, [the only two parks](https://liveinmelbourne.vic.gov.au/discover/things-to-do-in-melbourne/childrens-activities-in-melbourne) in the region are: \n",
    "\t\n",
    "- Luna Park located in the inner city suburb of St. Kilda, at 8 kilometres from the central business district, with an area of over 11 thousand square metres. It opened in 1912, contains 20 attractions and operates year round.\n",
    "-  Adventure Park located in the nearby city of Geelong, at 92 kilometres from the central business district, with an area of over 2 square kilometres. It opened in 1994, contains 20 attractions and operates from October to April, which correspond to the summer months in Australia.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "Therefore, **the aim of this project is to identify the location of a new attraction park** closer to the central business district than Adventure Park, and an available area for expansion larger than Luna Park. The location should be within the metropolitan region, close to population growth corridors, with a high number of families nearby. Ideally, the location should be close to a suburban train station and other amenities like shopping centres, museums or zoological parks. The project would not focus on the economical feasibility of the park, but the families in the vicinity should have a moderate income that would allow them visit the park often. Interested parties would be developers, government entities, and families.\n",

The data is in the file `victoria_postcodes.csv` and was imported using the `pandas` package. It is noteworthy that some suburbs have more postcodes associated to it. Therefore, the data was pre-processed to group each postcode with a unique suburb name. Moreover, any suburb that does not correspond to the Melbourne metropolitan area (which are marked with the regions `vic far country` and `vic country`) were removed."

This file was a bit tricky to pre-process in Jupyter Notebooks, due to a nested structure in the `geometry` variable, which contained the coordinates of the boundary points. Given the limtied amount of time for this project, I decided to use [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/) to obtain the centroid and the area in squared kilometers. The interested reader can check the MATLAB script provided [here](https://github.com/andremun/Coursera_Capstone/blob/master/preprocess_vic_suburbs.m), whereas the figure below shows the boundary data.\n",

The third dataset corresponds to the population by age (in five year increments) and it is in the `age_by_postcode.csv` file, while the fourth dataset corresponds to the population by  weekly income and it is in the `income_by_postcode.csv` file. From this data we are interested in calculating:\n",

    "4. The affluent population of each suburb, or thsoe with an income in or above the national median of 66,000 dollars per year, or about 1,300 dollars per week before taxes.\n",
